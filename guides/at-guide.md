Practice your skills in Jensen's Range until you are comfortable with the different weapons, rounds, and travel times. Start with the LAT kit and then move on the the HAT role once you are comfortable with LAT gameplay.

## Quick Tips and Tricks

Collection of tips and tricks for improving your AT skills.

**LAT vs HAT**

As a LAT you do not have the damage dealing capabilities of a HAT. As a result, you need to play your kit accordingly. You should engage light vehicles with a LAT kit (MRAPs/TIGRs, etc). They have the ability to take our your squad and have very little health and armour. Your primary objective when enaging heavier vehicles (APCs, IFVs, and Tanks) should be to disable them for your team's HAT kits and vehicles to finish off. Aim for the engine of wheeled vehicles or the tracks on Tanks/IFVs.

HATs have the ability to consistently deal heavy damage to Vehicles with their tandem warheads. You will

**Warhead Types**

There are multiple types of warheads that LAT and HAT weapons use. They can essentially be broken down into 3 categories

- Anti-personel (Frag and HE). These will not damage vehicles, but are very effective vs infantry.
- Light AT (HEAT). Useful for disabling heavy vehicles (track/engine) and damaging light vehicles/helicopters.
- Heavy AT (Tandem). Highest penetration/damage rounds. Will deal high damage to heavy vehicles.

**Vehicle Weak Spots**

There is a great resource to learn the weak spots of vehicles, in the advanced resources above that we recommend you read through.

**Arming Distance**

Beware the arming distance of your warheads! Most HEAT and Frag warheads have an arming distance of 25m. Tandem rounds on the other hand have varying arming distances. The RPG-7 tandem has a 22m arming distance, the NLAW has an 80m arming distance. Ensure you take this into consideration when positioning yourself in an ambush. Learn the arming distance of the weapon you are using to avoid soul crushing "dings".

**Ranging Techniques**

There are three primary ranging techniques you should be comfortable with:

- Squad Leader Marks. If you are playing close to your squadleader and they aren't busy, ask for a ranging mark. You probably only need this on targets over 150m away.
- Fire Team Lead marks and your map. As an AT, I would recommend that you ask your squad lead for a Fire Team Lead. This is useful as you can place marks on vehicles which will show up on your map. You can use your map's distance markers to estimate the range to a vehicle from there.
- Binoculars. You can range with your binoculars. Check out the Moidawg video above for a guide.

**Positioning and teamplay**

Play with your squad as an AT. Ask your squad lead to ensure that you have at least one rifleman playing with you at all times. It may be the difference between your squad taking out a vehicle and being completely wiped. You should not be running away from your squad to destroy vehicles unless they are significantly disturbing your team or squad's ability to play the objective. Ensure your squad leader is okay when you run off to engage a vehicle.

Play close to the other ATs and Riflemen in your squad. Together, you can quickly eliminate targets for your squad and team.Think about where the enemy vehicles are most likely to come from. A hill above an intersection is a great place to position yourself.

If you are a fire team lead as an AT (and you should ask your squad leader to be one), mark targets on the map. Use the correct mark for the vehicle you see. This benefits your entire team. It ensures that your team's vehicles know where other theats are so they can avoid or engage them. This is also true for other squadleaders moving around the map in logistics vehicles and helicopters. Your mark may lead to a vehicle being destroyed, or another squad being saved from destruction.
